<h1>Button LED</h1>
<p>
    This project introduces the concept of using an Arduino to read input from a physical component and control an output. 
    By connecting a push button and an LED to digital pins, the Arduino turns the LED on or off in response to the button press. 
    It's a great way to learn how microcontrollers handle input signals and interact with hardware through code.
</p>
<p>
    A simple circuit was created using a push button, a 220Ω and 10kΩ resistor, an LED, and a few wires and a button,
    then programmed with basic Arduino functions like digitalRead and digitalWrite.
