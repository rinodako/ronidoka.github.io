<h1>Flashing LED</h1>
<p>
    This project is a simple introduction to using an Arduino to control electronic components. 
    By connecting a single LED to a digital pin and using basic timing functions in the code, the Arduino repeatedly turns the LED on and off. 
    It's a great starting point for learning how microcontrollers handle digital outputs and how code interacts with physical hardware.

    A simple circuit was created using a 220Ω resistor, an LED, and a few wires, 
    then programmed with basic Arduino functions like digitalWrite and delay().
